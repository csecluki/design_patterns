# Design Patterns
Short examples of design patterns implementation with description. All examples are pizza related.

Design patterns are like pre-packaged solutions for software developers to use when they're faced with common problems during the design and implementation of software applications. They help developers create software that's easy to change, easy to add on to, and easy to keep up with.

There are different categories of design patterns, including:

 1. Creational Patterns: These help developers create objects that are flexible and easy to use.
 2. Structural Patterns: These help developers make complex structures from simple objects and classes.
 3. Behavioral Patterns: These are all about how objects talk to each other and manage their relationships.

By using design patterns, developers can create software that's easier to maintain, easier to extend, and less prone to bugs and errors.
